# Status
(audrNa) This is a project I've worked on for 2 months for learning. There are more things I can add to this game but as I am inexperienced, it's best I keep it simple and not go too far with the scope. I published this here on GitHub for my friends to try out. This project is now finished for me, I may still be around to make a few changes or add some new features if I can.
